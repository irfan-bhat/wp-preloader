## Frequently Asked Questions

### My theme does not support `wp_body_open()`. What should I do?

Add `<?php wp_body_open(); ?>` right after the opening `<body>` tag in your theme's `header.php`. This hook is required for the preloader to appear on the front end.

### Can I disable the preloader on mobile devices?

Yes. Use the mobile toggle on the settings page to disable the preloader for mobile visitors.

### How do I customize the overlay and blur effect?

Use the admin settings to choose an overlay tint color, adjust opacity, and set blur strength between 0 and 40px.
