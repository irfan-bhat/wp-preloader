## ❓ FAQ

### Q: My theme doesn't support `wp_body_open()`. What can I do?

**A:** Manually add `<?php wp_body_open(); ?>` to your theme's `header.php` immediately after the opening `<body>` tag. This hook is required for the preloader to render.

### Q: Can I disable the preloader on mobile devices?

**A:** Yes. In **Settings › WP Preloader**, toggle the "Show on mobile devices" option off to disable it for mobile visitors.

### Q: How do I customize the overlay and blur effect?

**A:** Use the admin settings panel to:
- Select overlay tint color
- Adjust opacity slider (0-100%)
- Set blur strength (0-40px)

### Q: How often does the plugin check for updates?

**A:** The plugin checks GitHub for new releases every 12 hours. You can manually force a check by clearing the transient in the database or deactivating/reactivating the plugin.

### Q: Is the preloader visible to search engines?

**A:** No. The preloader is hidden via inline JavaScript and CSS, and only displays to end-users, not bot crawlers.

### Q: Can I customize the preloader appearance further?

**A:** Yes. All CSS variables and animations are defined in `css/preloader.css`. Advanced users can override styles using custom CSS in their theme.
